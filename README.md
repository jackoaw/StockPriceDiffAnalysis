The original purpose of this program was to help determine risk when selling Options, particularly those for SPY. You will be able to give this program historical data and it will check the percentage of change between __ days among the set of data then graph it using a standard deviation chart. It will also print out the percentages of change associated with the number of times that percentage of change occured. 

You can run the program as such:

python visualize_change.py \<filename\> \<days\>

# Stock Price Differential Analysis

The purpose of this application is to determine the POC (percentage of change) among a given set of days over time. It will also visualize it for you using a standard deviation chart and provide you with standard deviations to use. This information is useful for making safer Option trades during non-volatile times.
